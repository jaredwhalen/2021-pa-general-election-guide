      <p>The state primary will be the second election where all registered Democrats and Republicans will have the option of voting from home in case they feel uncomfortable going to the polls due to the pandemic. The state has mailed applications for mail-in ballots to registered Democrats and Republicans for this election. Elections Commissioner Anthony Albence is urging Delawareans who are voting in the 2020 elections to return their mail-in ballots as soon as possible. The state plans on keeping all of its polling places open for those who are comfortable voting in-person.</p>
